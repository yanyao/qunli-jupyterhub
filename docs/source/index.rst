JupyterHub
==========

`JupyterHub`_, a multi-user **Hub**, spawns, manages, and proxies multiple
instances of the single-user `Jupyter notebook`_ server.
JupyterHub can be used to serve notebooks to a class of students, a corporate
data science group, or a scientific research group.

Three subsystems make up JupyterHub:

* a multi-user **Hub** (tornado process)
* a **configurable http proxy** (node-http-proxy)
* multiple **single-user Jupyter notebook servers** (Python/IPython/tornado)

JupyterHub performs the following functions:

- The Hub launches a proxy
- The proxy forwards all requests to the Hub by default
- The Hub handles user login and spawns single-user servers on demand
- The Hub configures the proxy to forward URL prefixes to the single-user
  notebook servers

For convenient administration of the Hub, its users, and services,
JupyterHub also provides a `REST API`_.

The JupyterHub team and Project Jupyter value our community, and JupyterHub
follows the Jupyter `Community Guides <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html>`_.

Distributions
-------------

A JupyterHub **distribution** is tailored towards a particular set of
use cases. These are generally easier to set up than setting up
JupyterHub from scratch, assuming they fit your use case.

The two popular ones are:

* `Zero to JupyterHub on Kubernetes <http://z2jh.jupyter.org>`_, for
  running JupyterHub on top of `Kubernetes <https://k8s.io>`_. This
  can scale to large number of machines & users.
* `The Littlest JupyterHub <http://tljh.jupyter.org>`_, for an easy
  to set up & run JupyterHub supporting 1-100 users on a single machine.
